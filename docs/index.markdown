# CfFlow

CfFlow is an open source workflow engine for the CFML language. It is inspired by the work and concepts of Open Symphony Workflow (OSWorkflow), an unmaintained Java workflow engine that is used in JIRA and many other java projects.

**The current release is BETA and subject to rapid change. The documentation here is also a work in progress with many sections still TODO as the work progresses**.

## Getting started

We suggest that you familiarize yourself with the [core terms and concepts](guides/concepts.markdown) and follow through the [quick start tutorial](tutorials/quick-start.markdown).
